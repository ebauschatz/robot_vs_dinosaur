# Robots vs Dinosaurs!
An epic battle between legendary foes!

A herd of dinosuars will battle a fleet of robots to determine the ultimate victor! Each individual group member will be able to make one attack per round, and the group that goes first is randomly determined at the beginning of each round. The weapon each robot uses for the next attack can be selected from a menu each round for each robot. An attack by any combatant has a random chance to either succeed or fail.
